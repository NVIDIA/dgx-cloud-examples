# Overview

## Lepton

NVIDIA DGX Cloud Lepton is an AI platform that connects developers to global GPU compute across a network of cloud providers to drive rapid 
innovation in the era of modern AI. It provides a unified experience across development, training, and inferencing. Developers can tap into a 
global network of cloud providers, GPU marketplaces, and their own local environments to create a large compute environment 
all managed through a single pane-view.
