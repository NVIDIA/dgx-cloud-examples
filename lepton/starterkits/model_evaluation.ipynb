There are many different benchmarks available to use in NeMo Evaluator: this [GitHub link](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator/tree/main/tutorials) provides tutorials and this [documentation page](https://nv-eval-platform-dl-joc-competitive-evaluation-c0c268c1aead4fd0.gitlab-master-pages.nvidia.com/benchmarks_doc) contains more details into the different benchmarks included and how to run them."
