        "# Training a non-English Reasoning Language Model on Lepton with NeMo 2.0\n",
        "\n",
        "[NVIDIA NeMo Framework](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/overview.html) is a powerful toolkit for training and fine-tuning Large Language Models. This notebook demonstrates how to create a reasoning-capable LLM for Spanish on Lepton using NeMo 2.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "While many state-of-the-art models perform well in English, their performance often degrades significantly in other languages. This tutorial shows how data translation, continued pre-training (CPT), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can be combined to create a model that reasons in English and outputs answers in Spanish. This approach maintains strong reasoning capabilities while enabling Spanish language output for better accessibility.\n",

        "This tutorial demonstrates a complete pipeline for training a reasoning-capable Large Language Model that reasons in English and outputs answers in Spanish, with a focus on the math domain:\n",
        "1. **Data Translation**: We will translate raw texts and instruction-tuning datasets with reasoning traces from English to Spanish\n",
        "2. **Continued Pre-Training (CPT)**: We will adapt the model to Spanish language and the math domain\n",
        "3. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: We will teach the model to reason in English and output answers in Spanish in the math domain\n",

        "  4. Run Continued Pre-Training (CPT)\n",
        "  5. Run Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\n",
